<p>What are http and https protocols? Explain in detail the following http methods.</p>
<br>
<p>
     'HTTP and HTTPS Protocols: <br> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are protocols used for communication between a client (typically a web browser) and a server (a web server or other resources on the internet). They define how data is transmitted over the internet and are the foundation of the World Wide Web.',
     'HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):<br>HTTP is the standard protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It operates on top of the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite, which ensures reliable data transmission. HTTP is a text-based protocol, and it uses a client-server model, where the client sends requests, and the server responds with data.',
     'HTTPS (HTTP Secure):<br>HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP. It uses the same basic principles as HTTP but adds an extra layer of security through the use of SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This encryption ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by malicious actors.',
